Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    It affects the way I can call the set toString in a class it also means I can alter a constructor by adding more paramaters. Another thing that is affected is being aware of when I have to throw excpetion erros because those would happen in the subclasses and not the superclass because the super is more general while the subclasses have specific instances where an error would occur.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked for me was working with my friends(Taylor and Kim) and talking it over to go review our logic and eventually identify our errors. What didn't work was not fully understanding the hashtable because we had skimmed through the website with the methods for it. Later we had realized that our code didn't work because we had misinterpreted a method. I advice students to go to office hours and to work in groups that way you can catch your error earlier on and finish sooner if there are more brains piecing everything together.
